# OSU Cloud Applications Final Project

This application was submitted as the final project for OSU's Cloud Applications class. The app uses Google's OAuth and Datastore solutions to serve a basic API that performs CRUD operations on three entities - Users, Fabrics, and Patterns - to represent a basic sewing project management tool. The app was deployed on Google Cloud Platform for assignment submission. 

Please see the PDF included in this repo for documentation of the data model and API endpoints.

Postman endpoint test environment and suite are included in the directory titled "tests".
